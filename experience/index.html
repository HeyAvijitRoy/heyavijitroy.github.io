    <h1 class="page-title">Experience</h1>
    <p>I bridge data, security, and applied AI to build impactful, real-world systems in education and public service.
      My focus is clear: combine research-grade rigor with scalable engineering to solve hard problems—whether
      streamlining multi-campus data workflows, safeguarding sensitive intel, or mentoring the next generation of
      engineers. I believe technology should not just function; it should empower. My work reflects that.</p>

          <p>As a Graduate Research Assistant, I architected a secure real-time intelligence platform supporting
            human-trafficking investigations. I built live map dashboards and analytics workflows while integrating
            security controls such as OAuth2, RBAC, encryption-at-rest, and audit logging to safeguard sensitive PII.
            The
            platform enabled investigators to surface geographic trends, coordinate response efforts, and analyze
            behavioral indicators with confidence and data integrity.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Developed a .NET Core / API backend and React-style admin interface enabling structured tip reporting,
              data retrieval, and investigative workflow support.</li>
            <li>Implemented real-time mapping features using Google Maps API, SignalR, and Hangfire to support live
              geospatial updates, asynchronous case processing and event notifications.</li>
            <li>Enforced security and compliance controls including OAuth2 authentication via Azure AD, TLS encryption
              in
              transit, field-level encryption at rest, RBAC to safeguard sensitive PII, and auditable access patterns.
            </li>
            <li>Designed comprehensive audit-logging, anomaly-detection, and data-integrity routines to identify
              suspicious access, tampering attempts, and unusual behavioral trends.</li>
            <li>Designed modular Razor/Bootstrap dashboards for filtering, drill-down review, and structured data
              export.
            </li>
            <li>Collaborated with investigators and administrators to create modular Razor/Bootstrap dashboard views
              supporting filtering, drill-down inspection, and structured export of demographic, vehicle, and behavioral
              data.</li>
            <li>Delivered flexible querying and data export features that enabled law enforcement, social services, and
              policy teams to generate actionable intelligence on trafficking indicators and geographic patterns.</li>

          <p>I oversaw the management, validation, and reconciliation of university-wide student records,
            implementing
            processes that improved data reliability across multiple campus systems. I developed automated
            comparison
            tools, reduced manual verification, and ensured alignment with institutional and regulatory
            requirements.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Built a C#/.NET application to automate cross-file student record comparison, reducing manual
              verification
              time by ~30%.</li>
            <li>Implemented unique-identifier matching and discrepancy indexing for reliable data alignment
              across
