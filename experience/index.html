    <p>I bridge data, security, and applied AI to build impactful, real-world systems in education and public service.
      My focus is clear: combine research-grade rigor with scalable engineering to solve hard problems—whether
      streamlining multi-campus data workflows, safeguarding sensitive intel, or mentoring the next generation of
      engineers. I believe technology should not just function; it should empower. My work reflects that.</p>
